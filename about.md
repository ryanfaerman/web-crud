I am a religious jew living in a non-jewish world trying to become a successful and a productive member of society.

I program, compete, create, build - anything that I find interesting; I learn something new everyday.

I build [iPhone Apps](http://notsooriginal.com), play some banjo or harmonica, [work](http://presentelearning.com) as a web developer, and enjoy my days with my wife, [Ayelet](http://iamayelet.com).
