title: Hello World
slug: welcome to dojigger


Welcome to **dojigger** a stupid simple poster tool without a web-based admin interface because I'm lazy.

Despite not having your standard interface, there are some features:

 - Markdown support
 - Command line post submission and management
 - Post straight up HTML so that any post can have its own style
 - Template support
 - Optional slugs (aka custom paths) for each entry
 - Tiny and light-weight
 - Supports YAML front matter

I'm sure there are some things that you might want from a thing like this, but I'm lazy and I'm betting you are too.
